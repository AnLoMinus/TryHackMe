- ## Task 1  Introduction

### Introduction
This room will introduce you to cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and various frameworks used to share intelligence.  
As security analysts, CTI is vital for investigating and reporting against adversary attacks with organisational stakeholders and external communities.

### Learning Objectives
The basics of CTI and its various classifications.
The lifecycle followed to deploy and use intelligence during threat investigations.
Frameworks and standards used in distributing intelligence.

### Cyber Threat Intelligence Module
﻿This is the first room in a new Cyber Threat Intelligence module.  
The module will also contain:

- [Threat Intelligence Tools](https://tryhackme.com/room/threatinteltools)
- [YARA](https://tryhackme.com/room/yara)
- [OpenCTI](https://tryhackme.com/room/opencti)
- [MISP](https://tryhackme.com/room/misp)

- ## Task 2  Cyber Threat Intelligence

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) can be defined as evidence-based knowledge about adversaries, including their indicators, tactics, motivations, and actionable advice against them.  
These can be utilised to protect critical assets and inform cybersecurity teams and management business decisions.

It would be typical to use the terms “data”, “information”, and “intelligence” interchangeably.  
However, let us distinguish between them to understand better how CTI comes into play.

- **Data**: Discrete indicators associated with an adversary such as IP addresses, URLs or hashes.

- **Information**: A combination of multiple data points that answer questions such as “How many times have employees accessed tryhackme.com within the month?”

- **Intelligence**: The correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on contextual analysis.

The primary goal of CTI is to understand the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary and how to defend your environment against any attacks.  
You would seek this goal by developing your cyber threat context by trying to answer the following questions:

- Who’s attacking you?
- What are their motivations?
- What are their capabilities?
- What artefacts and indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you look out for?
