# [Task 1  Introduction]()
- Empire, a C2 or Command and Control server created by BC-Security, used to deploy agents onto a device and remotely run modules. 
- Empire is a free and open-source alternative to other command and control servers like the well known Cobalt Strike C2. 
- In this room, we will cover the basics of setting up a listener and stager as well as what types are available, then learn how to use an agent on a device.

- The virtual machine used in this room is [`Blue`](https://tryhackme.com/room/blue) created by DarkStar7417 you can download the box for offline use here or deploy the box on Tryhackme in Task 6.
- Before completing this room we recommend completing the '[`What the Shell`](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells)' room by MuirlandOracle and ''Blue' by DarkStar7471.
- If you have a general understanding of basic reverse shells and exploitation techniques then you will be ready to begin.

# [Task 2  Deploy!]()
- Before we can move on to using Empire we need to deploy a machine to connect the Empire server with.
- Deploy this machine and discover what exploit this machine is vulnerable to. 
- The virtual machine used in this room (Blue) can be downloaded for offline usage from https://darkstar7471.com/resources.html
- We recommend completing the room '[`Blue`](https://tryhackme.com/room/blue)' prior to this room for this purpose alone.
