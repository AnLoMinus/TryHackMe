## Task 1  [What is the Purpose of Malware Analysis?]()
#### Malware is such a prevalent topic within Cybersecurity, and often an unfortunately recurring theme among global news today.

Not only is malware analysis a form of incidence response, but it is also useful in understanding how the behaviours of variants of malware result in their respective categorisation.  

This room will be a practical introduction to the techniques and tools used throughout malware analysis - albeit brief, I hope to expand on these techniques a lot more in-depth within the future.

#### When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:

- Point of Entry (PoE) I.e. 
- [ ] Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering missed and the user opened the attachment? 
- Let's review our spam filters and train our users better for future prevention!

- [ ] What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? 
- [ ] Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?

- [ ] How does the malware perform? 
- [ ] Does it attempt to infect other devices? 
- [ ] Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?

- [ ] Most importantly - can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!

## Task 2  [Understanding Malware Campaigns]()

Despite the many variants of malware, attacks can generally be classified into two types: Targeted and Mass Campaign.

### Targeted

A "Targeted" attack is just that - targeted.  
In most cases, malware attacks that occur this way are created for a specific purpose against a specific target.  
A great example of this type of purpose could be the DarkHotel malware, whom is designed to steal information such as authentication details from government officials.  

### Mass Campaign

On the other hand, the "Mass Campaign" classification can be akin to many real life examples, and is the most common type of attacks.  
The entire purpose of this type of Malware is to infect as many devices as possible and perform whatever it may - regardless of target.  

Companies such as Kaspersky to name one, track these campaigns (known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and often report on their infection rate and indicators, much akin to the real-life spread of a virus from the World Health Organisation (WHO). 

Kaspersky report on the "Crouching Yeti (Energetic Bear)" campaign, this campaign specifically targets the following:

- Industrial/machinery
- Manufacturing
- Pharmaceutical
- Construction
- Education
- Information technology

(Kaspersky)

Whilst it this variant is technically targeted, there is a rather large scope of this variant of malware, and as such, can be considered as a "Mass Campaign" attack.
