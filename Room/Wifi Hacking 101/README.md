### Key Terms
- **`SSID`**: The network "name" that you see when you try and connect
- **`ESSID`**: An SSID that *may* apply to multiple access points, eg a company office, normally forming a bigger network. 
  - For Aircrack they normally refer to the network you're attacking.
- **`BSSID`**: An access point MAC (hardware) address
- **`WPA2-PSK`**: Wifi networks that you connect to by providing a password that's the same for everyone
- **`WPA2-EAP`**: Wifi networks that you authenticate to by providing a username and password, which is sent to a RADIUS server.
- **`RADIUS`**: A server for authenticating clients, not just for wifi.
