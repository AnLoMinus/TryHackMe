# [Zeek](https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro)
## Introduction to hands-on network monitoring and threat detection with Zeek (formerly Bro).
### Zeek (formerly Bro) is an open-source and commercial network monitoring tool (traffic analyser).
- [The official description](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/about.html); "Zeek (formerly Bro) is the world's leading platform for network security monitoring. 
- Flexible, open-source, and powered by defenders." "Zeek is a passive, open-source network traffic analyser.

## [Task 1  Introduction]()

- The room aims to provide a general network monitoring overview and work with Zeek to investigate captured traffic. 
- This room will expect you to have basic Linux familiarity and Network fundamentals (ports, protocols and traffic data). 
- We suggest completing the "[Network Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-fundamentals)" path before starting working in this room. 

- A VM is attached to this room. 
- You don't need SSH or RDP; the room provides a "Split View" feature. 
- Exercise files are located in the folder on the desktop. 
- Log cleaner script "clear-logs.sh" is available in each exercise folder.
