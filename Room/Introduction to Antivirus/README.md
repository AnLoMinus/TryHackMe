## Task 1  Introduction

### Welcome to Intro to AV
- Antivirus (AV) software is one of the essential host-based security solutions available to detect and prevent malware attacks within the end-user's machine. 
- AV software consists of different modules, features, and detection techniques, which are discussed in this room.
- As a red teamer or pentester, it is essential to be familiar with and understand how AV software and its detection techniques work. 
- Once this knowledge is acquired, it will be easier to work toward AV evasion techniques.

### Learning Objectives
- What is Antivirus software?
- Antivirus detection approaches
- Enumerate installed AV software in the target machine
- Test in a simulated environment

### Room prerequisites
- General knowledge of host-based detection solutions; check [`The Lay of the Land`](https://tryhackme.com/room/thelayoftheland) room for more information.
- General experience with Hashing crypto; check the [`Hashing - Crypto 101`](https://tryhackme.com/room/hashingcrypto101) room for more information.
- Basic knowledge of Yara Rules; check the THM [`Yara`](https://tryhackme.com/room/yara) room for more information.
