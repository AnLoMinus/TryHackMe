# [Task 1  `Information` Introduction]()

- Our existence in a digital world makes it imperative that we understand and can protect against common attacks.
- This room will discuss some of the most common techniques used by attackers to target people online. 
- It will also teach some of the best ways to prevent the success of each technique.
- Without further ado, let's begin!

# [Task 2  `Common Attacks` Social Engineering]()

### What is Social Engineering?
- Social Engineering is the term used to describe any cyberattack where a human (rather than a computer) is the target; 
  - for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as "`People Hacking`". 
- For example, if an attacker wishes to obtain a victim's password, they could attempt to guess or brute-force the password â€” or they could [`simply ask you`](https://youtu.be/opRMrEfAIiI?t=42).
- Whilst the example linked above is relatively straightforward, social engineering attacks can become very complex and often result in an attacker gaining significant control over a target's life â€” both online and offline. 
- Social engineering attacks are often multi-layered and escalate due to the snowball effect. 
- For example, an attacker may start off by obtaining a small amount of publicly available information from a victim's social media presence, which they could then use to get more information from, say, your phone or broadband provider. 
- The information obtained from the second stage could then be used to gain more useful information, then escalate step-by-step to something like the victim's bank account.
- The best way to understand social engineering is to see it in action! 
- These videos from [`Defcon23`](https://youtu.be/fHhNWAKw0bY?t=100) (one of the largest hacking conferences in the world) and [`CNN`](https://youtu.be/PWVN3Rq4gzw) demonstrate some of the immense power in social engineering.
- They are both well worth a watch!

### Other Forms of Social Engineering
- Charismatic hackers calling your phone company and taking possession of your account is one form of social engineering; however, there are many Decorative image of a USB driveother types. 
- Social engineering is a vast topic, encompassing any attack that relies on tricking humans into giving the attacker access, rather than attacking the technology directly. 
- Whilst direct interaction with targets is the most common style of social engineering, other examples include dropping USB storage devices in public (e.g. in company car parks) in the hope that someone (often a company employee) will pick one up and plug it into a sensitive computer. 
- In a similar vein, attackers may leave a "charging cable" plugged into a socket in a public place. 
- In actuality, the cable contains malicious software such as keyloggers or tools to take control of the victim's device.

Case Study: Stuxnet (`Click to Read`)
  </summary>

Stuxnet was the name given to a particularly nasty computer virus (allegedly developed by the governments of the United States and Israel) that was originally used to target the Iran nuclear programme in 2009. Due to its ability as a "worm" to self-replicate (i.e. clone itself across networks â€” including the internet), the virus escaped and became much more widespread than was intended. Multiple variants now also exist, making Stuxnet a particularly hard-hitting and notorious weapon. You can read more about the background of Stuxnet here.

- In short, the limits to social engineering are at the bounds of an attacker's imagination. 
- A good social engineer can (and will) use a plethora of psychological tricks under any plausible context to "hack" their targets.

### Staying Safe from Social Engineering Attacks
- In many ways, it is very tricky to stay safe from social engineering as it won't always be you who the attacker is talking to, but rather someone who can give them what they need without your consent (e.g. calling your bank whilst pretending to be you, so as to access your bank account). 
- That said, there are still measures you can take to protect yourself from Social Engineering attacks:
  - Always make sure to set up multiple forms of authentication, and ensure that providers respect these. 
    - For example, set difficult to guess â€” or otherwise incorrect â€” answers to security questions (making sure to store the answers somewhere safe!), and make sure that these questions are asked when you try to access accounts over the phone.
  - Never plug external media (e.g. USBs/CDs/etc) into a computer that you care about or that is connected to any other devices. 
    - Ideally, don't plug the media in at all, and instead give it to your local police for safekeeping.
  - Always insist on proof of identity when a stranger calls or messages you claiming to work for a company whose services you use. 
    - Where possible, confirm with a known phone number or email address that the call or message you received was legitimate (i.e. use a trusted method to get in contact with the company to confirm). 
    - Remember that no legitimate employee will ever ask for your password or other information that protects your account.
