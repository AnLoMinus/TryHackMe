## [Task 1  `Information` Introduction]()

- Our existence in a digital world makes it imperative that we understand and can protect against common attacks.
- This room will discuss some of the most common techniques used by attackers to target people online. 
- It will also teach some of the best ways to prevent the success of each technique.
- Without further ado, let's begin!

### Answer the questions below

## [Task 2  `Common Attacks` Social Engineering]()

### What is Social Engineering?
- Social Engineering is the term used to describe any cyberattack where a human (rather than a computer) is the target; 
  - for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as "`People Hacking`". 
- For example, if an attacker wishes to obtain a victim's password, they could attempt to guess or brute-force the password â€” or they could [`simply ask you`](https://youtu.be/opRMrEfAIiI?t=42).
- Whilst the example linked above is relatively straightforward, social engineering attacks can become very complex and often result in an attacker gaining significant control over a target's life â€” both online and offline. 
- Social engineering attacks are often multi-layered and escalate due to the snowball effect. 
- For example, an attacker may start off by obtaining a small amount of publicly available information from a victim's social media presence, which they could then use to get more information from, say, your phone or broadband provider. 
- The information obtained from the second stage could then be used to gain more useful information, then escalate step-by-step to something like the victim's bank account.
