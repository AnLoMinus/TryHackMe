# [Task 2  `Common Attacks` Social Engineering]()

### What is Social Engineering?
- Social Engineering is the term used to describe any cyberattack where a human (rather than a computer) is the target; 
  - for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as "`People Hacking`". 
- For example, if an attacker wishes to obtain a victim's password, they could attempt to guess or brute-force the password â€” or they could [`simply ask you`](https://youtu.be/opRMrEfAIiI?t=42).
- Whilst the example linked above is relatively straightforward, social engineering attacks can become very complex and often result in an attacker gaining significant control over a target's life â€” both online and offline. 
- Social engineering attacks are often multi-layered and escalate due to the snowball effect. 
- For example, an attacker may start off by obtaining a small amount of publicly available information from a victim's social media presence, which they could then use to get more information from, say, your phone or broadband provider. 
- The information obtained from the second stage could then be used to gain more useful information, then escalate step-by-step to something like the victim's bank account.
- The best way to understand social engineering is to see it in action! 
- These videos from [`Defcon23`](https://youtu.be/fHhNWAKw0bY?t=100) (one of the largest hacking conferences in the world) and [`CNN`](https://youtu.be/PWVN3Rq4gzw) demonstrate some of the immense power in social engineering.
- They are both well worth a watch!

### Other Forms of Social Engineering
- Charismatic hackers calling your phone company and taking possession of your account is one form of social engineering; however, there are many Decorative image of a USB driveother types. 
- Social engineering is a vast topic, encompassing any attack that relies on tricking humans into giving the attacker access, rather than attacking the technology directly. 
- Whilst direct interaction with targets is the most common style of social engineering, other examples include dropping USB storage devices in public (e.g. in company car parks) in the hope that someone (often a company employee) will pick one up and plug it into a sensitive computer. 
- In a similar vein, attackers may leave a "charging cable" plugged into a socket in a public place. 
- In actuality, the cable contains malicious software such as keyloggers or tools to take control of the victim's device.

Case Study: Stuxnet (`Click to Read`)
  </summary>

Stuxnet was the name given to a particularly nasty computer virus (allegedly developed by the governments of the United States and Israel) that was originally used to target the Iran nuclear programme in 2009. Due to its ability as a "worm" to self-replicate (i.e. clone itself across networks â€” including the internet), the virus escaped and became much more widespread than was intended. Multiple variants now also exist, making Stuxnet a particularly hard-hitting and notorious weapon. You can read more about the background of Stuxnet here.

- In short, the limits to social engineering are at the bounds of an attacker's imagination. 
- A good social engineer can (and will) use a plethora of psychological tricks under any plausible context to "hack" their targets.

### Staying Safe from Social Engineering Attacks
- In many ways, it is very tricky to stay safe from social engineering as it won't always be you who the attacker is talking to, but rather someone who can give them what they need without your consent (e.g. calling your bank whilst pretending to be you, so as to access your bank account). 
- That said, there are still measures you can take to protect yourself from Social Engineering attacks:
  - Always make sure to set up multiple forms of authentication, and ensure that providers respect these. 
    - For example, set difficult to guess â€” or otherwise incorrect â€” answers to security questions (making sure to store the answers somewhere safe!), and make sure that these questions are asked when you try to access accounts over the phone.
  - Never plug external media (e.g. USBs/CDs/etc) into a computer that you care about or that is connected to any other devices. 
    - Ideally, don't plug the media in at all, and instead give it to your local police for safekeeping.
  - Always insist on proof of identity when a stranger calls or messages you claiming to work for a company whose services you use. 
    - Where possible, confirm with a known phone number or email address that the call or message you received was legitimate (i.e. use a trusted method to get in contact with the company to confirm). 
    - Remember that no legitimate employee will ever ask for your password or other information that protects your account.

# [Task 3  `Common Attacks` Social Engineering: Phishing]()

### Overview
- Phishing is one of the most common cyber attack types employed by scammers and bad actors, targeting individuals and businesses indiscriminately. 
- In many cases, phishing is the initial attack vector used to gain access to a company's infrastructure before performing further attacks against the corporate network. 
- Whilst there are many automated tools now available to help combat phishing threats, phishing is still one of the most prolific attack vectors around.

### What is Phishing?
- Phishing is a sub-section of social engineering. 
- Whereas social engineering is a very general term used to describe any attack that takes advantage of a human rather than a computer system, phishing specifically describes attacks whereby a scammer or other attacker tricks a victim into opening a malicious webpage by sending them a text message, email, or another form of online correspondence. 
- Traditionally, "phishing" simply referred to emails; however, in the days of instant messaging, text messages, and voice/video calling, the term has evolved to blanket these other categories. 
- These other forms are sometimes referred to individually as "smishing" â€” phishing over SMS â€” and "vishing" â€” phishing over voice chat â€” respectively.
- These attacks are very widespread (indeed, the chances of you not having been on the receiving end of such an attack are slim!) and are frequently deployed on massive scales using lists of leaked or stolen phone numbers and email addresses.
- Phishing messages usually deploy psychological trickery (for example, inducing a false sense of urgency to make victims act rashly) and nearly always involve getting a victim to click on a link to a web application owned by the attacker. 
- The victim is then often asked to enter sensitive information â€” for example, login details or credit card information â€” at which point the malicious site stores the information and the attack is complete. 
- Alternatively, the victim may inadvertently install malware from the malicious page, thus giving an attacker an entry point into their device and network.

#### There are three primary types of phishing attacks:

|    **Attack Type**   |                                                                                                                                                                                        **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:---------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **General Phishing** | A simple, mass phishing attack which doesn't target anyone in particular, although they may aim for large groups (e.g. PayPal users, or Amazon customers). <br> These large-scale campaigns are usually simple and are generally (but not always) fairly easy to spot as the messages and malicious sites are often not very well crafted and frequently contain many immediately visible errors. |
|   **Spearphishing**  |         More targeted than general phishing, spearphishing aims for an individual or small group (e.g. employees of a specific company). <br> Spearphishing campaigns are generally better crafted than the correspondence and malicious sites used in general phishing as they are designed to target a particular group, often as part of a more extensive campaign against the target.         |
|      **Whaling**     |                                                                                       Even more specific than spearphishing, whaling targets high-value individuals (e.g. a C-Suite executive in a target company). <br> The messages are generally extremely well crafted and tend to be very hard to spot.                                                                                      |

- Be aware that you are much more likely to encounter a general phishing attack than a spearphishing or whaling attack in your day-to-day life. 
- This may not be the case in your work life, however â€” especially if you are a high-ranking member of a company.
- An example of a popular general phishing scenario (or "pretext") would be receiving an email purportedly from "Amazon", informing you that your account has been used to buy a very costly item (e.g. the latest iPad). 
- You are then provided with a link to view your purchase history. 
- The link looks like it goes to https://amazon.co.uk but will actually take you to an attacker-controlled web application (that looks identical to the Amazon login page), asking you to enter your Amazon credentials. 
- When you enter your credentials, you get redirected to the real Amazon orders page, where you find that there are no unauthorised purchases... yet. 
- The attacker will then use your duly provided credentials to actually order expensive items with your account.

#### This process is shown in the following diagram:
- The attacker sends out a malicious phishing email campaign
- Prospective victims receive the emails â€” some of them open the email and click the link
- The victims enter their credentials into the attacker's fake web page
- The web page stores the credentials or sends them directly to the attacker
- The attacker uses the credentials to access the site, thus taking over the victims' accounts

- Phishing attacks work best when the malicious web page mimics an existing (usually well-known) web page. 
- For this reason, attackers/scammers will usually use one of many freely available tools to simply clone an existing page, which can then be edited at their leisure.
- The end goal of a phishing attack can vary significantly depending on who is performing the attack. 
- For example, a low-level scammer may simply be after sensitive information (e.g., bank details), whereas a high-powered group of malicious hackers may be targeting a specific organisation with the intention of causing further damage.

### Identifying Phishing Attacks
- Many generic phishing attacks are relatively easy to spot; they frequently have poor grammar and often do not address their victims by name (instead leaving the greetings generic â€” e.g., "Dear customer"). 
- That said, other instances can be extremely difficult to spot, with some attacks being thorough enough to fool cybersecurity professionals.
- Regardless of the attack type, in many cases, the pretext will be plausible â€” for example: 
  - the Amazon scam listed above, or a (fake) message from your "bank" telling you that there has been unusual activity with your account and to please log in to review it. 
  - This is especially true for spearphishing or whaling attacks where the pretext will be very carefully tailored to the target.
- Equally, the domain name for the malicious site will usually be similar (but never identical) to the domain name used by the legitimate website. 
- As a real-world example from 2021, a group of scammers sent out a mass phishing campaign over SMS, mimicking the British Royal Mail service and using the domain name https://royalmai1.co.uk (as opposed to https://royalmail.co.uk). 
- By exchanging the final "L" for the number one, the scammers were able to successfully register a domain name that looked almost identical to the domain name of their cloned website; this is a very common tactic.
- Also, bear in mind that HTML emails (effectively any email that looks fancy and contains formatting/graphics) can also be used to mask the real domain name in use. 
  - For example, the text in the email may be "https://amazon.co.uk"; however, the link actually goes to "https://am4zon.co.uk". 
  - You can see this by hovering your mouse over the link in a desktop application â€” the real link should appear at the bottom of the screen as in this graphic:
  > ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/180638700-5348506f-4781-4884-9435-e846e87c5f89.png)
- In a similar vein, the "From" email address in an email-based phishing campaign will often be suspicious. 
- Many generic mass phishing campaigns will simply use Gmail addresses â€” not bothering to use a domain name associated with the company they are spoofing.
- This is a dead giveaway that the email is suspicious.
- The best way to identify a phishing email is simply to keep your eyes open and look for anything suspicious â€” all but the best will have a mistake somewhere.
 
### Staying Safe from Phishing Attacks
#### There are a variety of things that you can (and should!) do to keep yourself safe from phishing attacks:
- Delete unknown or untrusted emails without opening them. 
- If you can see anything suspicious in the email, also report it as spam to your email provider, or forward it to your IT Security department if you received the email at work.
- Never open attachments from untrusted emails â€” this includes any attachments from a legitimate contact that you were not expecting.
- Do not click on embedded links in emails or messages. 
- Where possible, navigate to the real website in your web browser and access the content that way. 
- If you absolutely must click on the link, ensure that the domain name is correct and that the link points to where you think it does.
- Always make sure that your device and antivirus software are up-to-date.
- Avoid making your personal information (e.g. email address and phone number) public if possible. 
- If you must publish personal details publicly, create a "burner" email address (a temporary address made for one purpose, then destroyed soon afterwards) for the occasion, then destroy it as soon as it is no longer required.
- It's worth noting at this point that anyone can fall for a phishing attack â€” especially a complex one that has been made to look very realistic. 
- If you accidentally fall for one, don't panic! Make sure that you change any affected passwords immediately, and contact IT Services if the attack happens at work.
