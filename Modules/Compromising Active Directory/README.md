# [Compromising Active Directory](https://tryhackme.com/module/hacking-active-directory)
### Learn and exploit Active Directory networks through core security issues stemming from misconfigurations.
#### Active Directory (AD) is used by approximately 90% of the Global Fortune 1000 companies.  
If an organisation's estate uses Microsoft Windows, you are almost guaranteed to find AD.  
Since AD is used for Identity and Access Management of the entire estate, it holds the keys to the kingdom, making it a very likely target for attackers.  
This module will teach you the basics of AD and take you on the typical journey of compromising AD during a red team.  
You will learn to breach AD, enumerate AD, exploit AD, and finally also deploy persistence through AD.
