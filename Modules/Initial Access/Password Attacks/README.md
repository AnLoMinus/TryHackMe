## What is a password?
Passwords are used as an authentication method for individuals to access computer systems or applications.  
Using passwords ensures the owner of the account is the only one who has access.  
However, if the password is shared or falls into the wrong hands, unauthorized changes to a given system could occur.  
Unauthorized access could potentially lead to changes in the system's overall status and health or damage the file system.  
Passwords are typically comprised of a combination of characters such as letters, numbers, and symbols.  
Thus, it is up to the user how they generate passwords!
