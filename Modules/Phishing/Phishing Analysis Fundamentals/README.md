## Task 1  Introduction


Spam and Phishing are common social engineering attacks.  
In social engineering, phishing attack vectors can be a phone call, a text message, or an email.  
As you should have already guessed, our focus is on email as the attack vector.  

We all should be somewhat familiar with what spam is.  
No matter what, these emails somehow find their way into our inboxes. 

The first email classified as spam dates back to 1978, and it's still thriving today. 

Phishing is a serious attack vector that you, as a defender, will have to defend against.

An organization can follow all the recommended guidelines when it comes to building a layered defense strategy.  
Still, all it takes is an inexperienced and unsuspecting user within your corporate environment to click on a link or download and run a malicious attachment which may provide an attacker a foothold into the network. 

Many products help combat spam and phishing, but realistically these emails still can get through.  
When they do, as a Security Analyst, you need to know how to analyze these emails to determine if they're malicious or benign.

Furthermore, you will need to gather information about the email to update your security products to prevent malicious emails from making their way back into a user's inbox. 

In this room, we'll look at all the components involved with sending emails across the Internet and how to analyze email headers.
