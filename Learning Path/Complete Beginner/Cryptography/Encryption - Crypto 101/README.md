#  Key Terms
- `Ciphertext` - The result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data
- `Cipher` - A method of encrypting or decrypting data. Modern ciphers are cryptographic, but there are many non cryptographic ciphers like Caesar.
- `Plaintext` - Data before encryption, often text but not always. Could be a photograph or other file
- `Encryption` - Transforming data into ciphertext, using a cipher.
- `Encoding` - NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.
- `Key` - Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.
- `Passphrase` - Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.
- `Asymmetric encryption` - Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.
- `Symmetric encryption` - Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt
- `Brute force` - Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key
- `Cryptanalysis` - Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths
