> - ## Task 1  [Introduction]()
> ### During a penetration test, you will often have access to some Windows hosts with an unprivileged user. <br>
> Unprivileged users will hold limited access, including their files and folders only, and have no means to perform administrative tasks on the host, preventing you from having complete control over your target. <br>
> This room covers fundamental techniques that attackers can use to elevate privileges in a Windows environment, allowing you to use any initial unprivileged foothold on a host to escalate to an administrator account, where possible. <br>
> #### If you want to brush up on your skills first, you can have a look through the [Windows Fundamentals Module](https://tryhackme.com/module/windows-fundamentals) or the [Hacking Windows Module](https://tryhackme.com/module/hacking-windows-1).

> - ## Task 2  [Windows Privilege Escalation]()
> #### Simply put, privilege escalation consists of using given access to a host with "user A" and leveraging it to gain access to "user B" by abusing a weakness in the target system. <br> While we will usually want "user B" to have administrative rights, there might be situations where we'll need to escalate into other unprivileged accounts before actually getting administrative privileges. <br> <br>
> #### Gaining access to different accounts can be as simple as finding credentials in text files or spreadsheets left unsecured by some careless user, but that won't always be the case. <br> Depending on the situation, we might need to abuse some of the following weaknesses:
> - Misconfigurations on Windows services or scheduled tasks
> - Excessive privileges assigned to our account 
> - Vulnerable software
> - Missing Windows security patches
