### A pathway to web application security.
- The aim of this path is to teach you how to attack web applications. 
- To successfully attack and exploit web applications, you need to understand how they work. 
- The first section (Web Fundamentals) will give you all the pre-requisite knowledge on this. 
- The second section (Security Tools) focuses on learning how to use Industry Standard tooling to interact with your targets. 
- The third section (Vulnerabilities) covers various vulnerabilities found in web applications today. 
- This section will go over root causes of these vulnerabilities and give you hands on experience on exploiting them.
- The final section (Practise Makes Perfect) will help you apply what you've learnt in previous sections.

### After completing this path, you should be able to:
*   Understand web fundamentals
*   Major vulnerabilities explained
*   Learn industry-used tools
*   Web application assessments
