Task 3  Linux Enumeration

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/197871968-405a5331-594b-4702-a9b9-6e5f4c11f0d7.png)

This task focuses on enumerating a Linux machine after accessing a shell, such as `bash`. Although some commands provide information on more than one area, we tried to group the commands into four categories depending on the information we expect to acquire.

- System
- Users
- Networking
- Running Services

We recommend that you click "Start AttackBox" and "Start Machine" so that you can experiment and answer the questions at the end of this task.

## System
On a Linux system, we can get more information about the Linux distribution and release version by searching for files or links that end with `-release` in `/etc/`. Running `ls /etc/*-release` helps us find such files. Let’s see what things look like on a CentOS Linux.

find such files. Let’s see what things look like on a CentOS Linux.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ ls /etc/*-release
/etc/centos-release  /etc/os-release  /etc/redhat-release  /etc/system-release
$ cat /etc/os-release 
NAME="CentOS Linux"
VERSION="7 (Core)"
[...]
```

Let’s try on a Fedora system.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ ls /etc/*-release
/etc/fedora-release@  /etc/os-release@  /etc/redhat-release@  /etc/system-release@
$ cat /etc/os-release
NAME="Fedora Linux"
VERSION="36 (Workstation Edition)"
[...]
```

We can find the system’s name using the command `hostname`.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ hostname
rpm-red-enum.thm
```

Various files on a system can provide plenty of useful information. In particular, consider the following `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, and `/etc/shadow`. Any user can read the files `passwd` and `group`. However, the `shadow` password file requires root privileges as it contains the hashed passwords. If you manage to break the hashes, you will know the user’s original password.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
[...]
michael:x:1001:1001::/home/michael:/bin/bash
peter:x:1002:1002::/home/peter:/bin/bash
jane:x:1003:1003::/home/jane:/bin/bash

```

Similarly, various directories can reveal information about users and might contain sensitive files; one is the mail directories found at `/var/mail/`.

To find the installed applications you can consider listing the files in `/usr/bin/` and `/sbin/`:

- `ls -lh /usr/bin/`
- `ls -lh /sbin/`

On an RPM-based Linux system, you can get a list of all installed packages using `rpm -qa`. The `-qa` indicates that we want to query all packages.

On a Debian-based Linux system, you can get the list of installed packages using `dpkg -l`. The output below is obtained from an Ubuntu server.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ dpkg -l
Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold

```

## 
Users
Files such as `/etc/passwd` reveal the usernames; however, various commands can provide more information and insights about other users on the system and their whereabouts.

You can show who is logged in using `who`.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ who
root     tty1         2022-05-18 13:24
jane     pts/0        2022-05-19 07:17 (10.20.30.105)
peter    pts/1        2022-05-19 07:13 (10.20.30.113)
```

We can see that the user `root` is logged in to the system directly, while the users `jane` and `peter` are connected over the network, and we can see their IP addresses.

Note that `who` should not be confused with `whoami` which prints your effective user id.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ whoami
jane
```

To take things to the next level, you can use `w`, which shows who is logged in and what they are doing. Based on the terminal output below, `peter` is editing `notes.txt` and `jane` is the one running `w` in this example.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ w
 07:18:43 up 18:05,  3 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
root     tty1                      Wed13   17:52m  0.00s  0.00s less -s
jane     pts/0    10.20.30.105     07:17    3.00s  0.01s  0.00s w
peter    pts/1    10.20.30.113     07:13    5:23   0.00s  0.00s vi notes.txt
```

To print the real and effective user and group IDS, you can issue the command `id` (for ID).

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ id
uid=1003(jane) gid=1003(jane) groups=1003(jane) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
```

Do you want to know who has been using the system recently? `last` displays a listing of the last logged-in users; moreover, we can see who logged out and how much they stayed connected. In the output below, the user `randa` remained logged in for almost 17 hours, while the user `michael` logged out after four minutes.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ last
jane     pts/0        10.20.30.105     Thu May 19 07:17   still logged in   
peter    pts/1        10.20.30.113     Thu May 19 07:13   still logged in   
michael  pts/0        10.20.30.1       Thu May 19 05:12 - 05:17  (00:04)    
randa    pts/1        10.20.30.107     Wed May 18 14:18 - 07:08  (16:49)    
root     tty1                          Wed May 18 13:24   still logged in
[...]
```

Finally, it is worth mentioning that `sudo -l` lists the allowed command for the invoking user on the current system.

## Networking

The IP addresses can be shown using `ip address show` (which can be shortened to `ip a s`) or with the older command `ifconfig -a` (its package is no longer maintained.) The terminal output below shows the network interface `ens33` with the IP address `10.20.30.129` and subnet mask `255.255.255.0` as it is `24`.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ ip a s
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

    link/ether 00:0c:29:a2:0e:7e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.20.30.129/24 brd 10.20.30.255 scope global noprefixroute dynamic ens33
       valid_lft 1580sec preferred_lft 1580sec
    inet6 fe80::761a:b360:78:26cd/64 scope link noprefixroute 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```


The DNS servers can be found in the `/etc/resolv.conf`. Consider the following terminal output for a system that uses DHCP for its network configurations. The DNS, i.e. nameserver, is set to `10.20.30.2`.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by NetworkManager
search localdomain thm
nameserver 10.20.30.2
```

`netstat` is a useful command for learning about network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics. We explain some of its many options in the table below.

| Option | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| -a | show both listening and non-listening sockets |
| -l | show only listening sockets |
| -n | show numeric output instead of resolving the IP address and port number |
| -t | TCP |
| -u | UDP |
| -x | UNIX |
| -p | Show the PID and name of the program to which the socket belongs |

You can use any combination that suits your needs. For instance, `netstat -plt` will return Programs Listening on TCP sockets. As we can see in the terminal output below, `sshd` is listening on the SSH port, while `master` is listening on the SMTP port on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Note that to get all PID (process ID) and program names, you need to run `netstat` as root or use `sudo netstat`.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ sudo netstat -plt
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

tcp        0      0 localhost:smtp          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1141/master         
tcp6       0      0 [::]:ssh                [::]:*                  LISTEN      978/sshd            
tcp6       0      0 localhost:smtp          [::]:*                  LISTEN      1141/master
```

`netstat -atupn` will show All TCP and UDP listening and established connections and the program names with addresses and ports in numeric format.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ sudo netstat -atupn
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:68              0.0.0.0:*                           5638/dhclient       
udp6       0      0 ::1:323                 :::*                                640/chronyd
```

One might think that using `nmap` before gaining access to the target machine would have provided a comparable result. However, this is not entirely true. Nmap needs to generate a relatively large number of packets to check for open ports, which can trigger intrusion detection and prevention systems. Furthermore, firewalls across the route can drop certain packets and hinder the scan, resulting in incomplete Nmap results.

`lsof` stands for List Open Files. If we want to display only Internet and network connections, we can use `lsof -i`. The terminal output below shows IPv4 and IPv6 listening services and ongoing connections. The user `peter` is connected to the server `rpm-red-enum`.thm on the `ssh` port. Note that to get the complete list of matching programs, you need to run `lsof` as root or use `sudo lsof`.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ sudo lsof -i
COMMAND   PID      USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
chronyd   640    chrony    5u  IPv4  16945      0t0  UDP localhost:323 
chronyd   640    chrony    6u  IPv6  16946      0t0  UDP localhost:323 
sshd      978      root    3u  IPv4  20035      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)
sshd      978      root    4u  IPv6  20058      0t0  TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)
master   1141      root   13u  IPv4  20665      0t0  TCP localhost:smtp (LISTEN)
master   1141      root   14u  IPv6  20666      0t0  TCP localhost:smtp (LISTEN)
dhclient 5638      root    6u  IPv4  47458      0t0  UDP *:bootpc

[...]
```

Because the list can get quite lengthy, you can further filter the output by specifying the ports you are interested in, such as SMTP port 25. By running `lsof -i :25`, we limit the output to those related to port 25, as shown in the terminal output below. The server is listening on port 25 on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ sudo lsof -i :25
COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
master  1141 root   13u  IPv4  20665      0t0  TCP localhost:smtp (LISTEN)
master  1141 root   14u  IPv6  20666      0t0  TCP localhost:smtp (LISTEN)
```

## Running Services
Getting a snapshot of the running processes can provide many insights. `ps` lets you discover the running processes and plenty of information about them.

You can list every process on the system using `ps -e`, where `-e` selects all processes. For more information about the process, you can add `-f` for full-format and `-l` for long format. Experiment with `ps -e`, `ps -ef`, and `ps -el`.

You can get comparable output and see all the processes using BSD syntax: `ps ax` or `ps aux`. Note that `a` and `x` are necessary when using BSD syntax as they lift the “only yourself” and “must have a tty” restrictions; in other words, it becomes possible to display all processes. The `u` is for details about the user that has the process.

| Option | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| -e | all processes |
| -f | full-format listing |
| -j | jobs format |
| -l | long format |
| -u | user-oriented format |

For more “visual” output, you can issue `ps axjf` to print a process tree. The `f` stands for “forest”, and it creates an ASCII art process hierarchy as shown in the terminal output below.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ ps axf
   PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
     2 ?        S      0:00 [kthreadd]

  1420 tty1     S+     0:00          \_ less -s
[...]
```

To summarize, remember to use `ps -ef` or `ps aux` to get a list of all the running processes. Consider piping the output via `grep` to display output lines with certain words. The terminal output below shows the lines with `peter` in them.

```cmd
user@TryHackMe$ ps -ef | grep peter
root       5665    978  0 07:11 ?        00:00:00 sshd: peter [priv]
peter      5693   5665  0 07:13 ?        00:00:00 sshd: peter@pts/1
peter      5694   5693  0 07:13 pts/1    00:00:00 -bash
peter      5713   5694  0 07:13 pts/1    00:00:00 vi notes.txt
```

Start the attached Linux machine if you have not done so already, as you need it to answer the questions below. You can log in to it using SSH: `ssh user@10.10.58.253`, where the login credentials are:

Username: `user`
Password: `THM6877`
