Task 3  Linux Enumeration

This task focuses on enumerating a Linux machine after accessing a shell, such as `bash`. Although some commands provide information on more than one area, we tried to group the commands into four categories depending on the information we expect to acquire.

- System
- Users
- Networking
- Running Services

We recommend that you click "Start AttackBox" and "Start Machine" so that you can experiment and answer the questions at the end of this task.

## System
On a Linux system, we can get more information about the Linux distribution and release version by searching for files or links that end with `-release` in `/etc/`. Running `ls /etc/*-release` helps us find such files. Letâ€™s see what things look like on a CentOS Linux.
