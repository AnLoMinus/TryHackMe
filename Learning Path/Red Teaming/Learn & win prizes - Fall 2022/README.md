What is the Red Teaming learning path?  
The aim of this pathway is to show you how to simulate a potential adversary attack in complex environments.  
Going beyond penetration testing, you will learn to conduct successful Red Team engagements and challenge the defence capability of your clients.  
  
As this is an intermediate pathway, we recommend beginners and early-intermediate users complete the [Introduction to Cyber Security](https://tryhackme.com/path-action/introtocyber/join) and [Jr Penetration Tester](https://tryhackme.com/path-action/presecurity/join) paths first.

This learning path will teach you how to execute adversary attack simulations as a Red Team Operator.
