- [x] Task 1  Introduction
- [x] Task 2  Basic Terminology
  > - `TTP` ~ Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures <br>
    > The `Tactic` is the adversary's goal or objective. <br>
    > The `Technique` is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective. <br>
    > The `Procedure` is how the technique is executed. <br>
  > - `APT` ~ Advanced Persistent Threat
  > - `TI` ~ Threat Intelligence
  > - `CTI` ~ Cyber Threat Intelligence
  > - `IOC` ~ Indicators of Compromise
  > ### Threat Intelligence is also broken up into three different types. <br>
  > - `Strategic` <br> Assist senior management make informed decisions specifically about the security budget and strategies. <br>
  > - `Tactical` <br> Interacts with the TTPs and attack models to identify adversary attack patterns. <br>
  > - `Operational` <br> Interact with IOCs and how the adversaries operationalize. <br>
- [x] Task 3  What is Threat Intelligence
  > - `ISAC` ~ Information Sharing and Analysis Centers 
- [x] Task 4  What are ISACs
  > Below is a list of ISACs that can help a blue team we will only be showcasing a few in this room.
  * [US-CERT](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/)
  * [AlienVault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com/)
  * [ThreatConnect](https://threatconnect.com/)
  * [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/)
- [x] Task 5  Using Threat Connect to create a Threat Intel dashboard
  > [Threat Connect](https://threatconnect.com/) focuses more on the information and new developments within cybersecurity and the threat landscape and connecting the landscape with indicators. <br>
  > This intelligence can help your team make better-informed decisions on what to prioritize. <br>
  > Threat Connect would fall under the tactical type of threat intelligence. <br>
