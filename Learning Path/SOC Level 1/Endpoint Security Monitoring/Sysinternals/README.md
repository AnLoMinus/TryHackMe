## Task 1  Introduction


What are the tools known as Sysinternals?

The Sysinternals tools is a compilation of over 70+ Windows-based tools. Each of the tools falls into one of the following categories:

- File and Disk Utilities
- Networking Utilities
- Process Utilities
- Security Utilities
- System Information
- Miscellaneous

The Sysinternals tools and its website (sysinternals.com) were created by Mark Russinovich in the late '90s, along Bryce Cogswell under the company Wininternals Software.
In 2006, Microsoft acquired Wininternals Software, and Mark Russinovich joined Microsoft. Today he is the CTO of Microsoft Azure. 

Mark Russinovich made headlines when he reported that Sony embedded rootkits into their music CDs back in 2005. This discovery was made known thanks to one of the Sysinternals tools he was testing. You can read more about that [here](https://www.virusbulletin.com/virusbulletin/2005/12/inside-sony-s-rootkit).  

He also discovered in 2006 that Symantec was using rootkit-like technology. You can read more about that [here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/symantec-confesses-to-using-rootkit-technology/). 

The Sysinternals tools are extremely popular among IT professionals who manage Windows systems. These tools are so popular that even red teamers and adversaries alike use them. Throughout this room, I'll note which tools MITRE has identified to have been used by adversaries. 

The goal of this room is to introduce you to a handful of Sysinternals tools with the hopes that you will expand on this knowledge with your own research and curiosity.

Hopefully, you can add Sysinternals to your toolkit, as many already have. 

If you want to access the virtual machine via [Remote Desktop](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/explain-like-i-m-5-remote-desktop-protocol-rdp), use the credentials below. 

- Machine IP: MACHINE_IP
- User: administrator
- Password: letmein123!

Accept the Certificate when prompted, and you should be logged into the remote system now.

> `Note`: The virtual machine may take up to 3 minutes to load.
