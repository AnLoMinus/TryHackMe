The room invites you a challenge to investigate a series of traffic data and stop malicious activity under different scenarios. Let's start working with Zeek to analyse the captured traffic.

We recommend completing the [Zeek](https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro) room first, which will teach you how to use the tool in depth.

A VM is attached to this room. You don't need SSH or RDP; the room provides a "Split View" feature. Exercise files are located in the folder on the desktop. Log cleaner script "clear-logs.sh" is available in each exercise folder.
