## Task 1  Introduction

In this room, we will cover the techniques and key points of traffic analysis with Wireshark and detect suspicious activities. Note that this is the third and last room of the Wireshark room trio, and it is suggested to visit the first two rooms stated below to practice and refresh your Wireshark skills before starting this one.

- [Wireshark: The Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharkthebasics)
- [Wireshark: Packet Operations](https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharkpacketoperations)

In the first two rooms, we have covered how to use Wireshark and do packet-level searches. Now, it is time to investigate and correlate the packet-level information to see the big picture in the network traffic, like detecting anomalies and malicious activities. For a security analyst, it is vital to stop and understand pieces of information spread in packets by applying the analyst's knowledge and tool functionality. This room will cover investigating packet-level details by synthesising the analyst knowledge and  Wireshark functionality for detecting anomalies and odd situations for a given case.

Note: A VM is attached to this room. You don't need SSH or RDP; the room provides a "Split View" feature. DO NOT directly interact with any domains and IP addresses in this room. The domains and IP addresses are included only for reference reasons.
