## Task 1  Introduction

In this room, we will cover the techniques and key points of traffic analysis with Wireshark and detect suspicious activities. Note that this is the third and last room of the Wireshark room trio, and it is suggested to visit the first two rooms stated below to practice and refresh your Wireshark skills before starting this one.

- [Wireshark: The Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharkthebasics)
- [Wireshark: Packet Operations](https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharkpacketoperations)

In the first two rooms, we have covered how to use Wireshark and do packet-level searches. Now, it is time to investigate and correlate the packet-level information to see the big picture in the network traffic, like detecting anomalies and malicious activities. For a security analyst, it is vital to stop and understand pieces of information spread in packets by applying the analyst's knowledge and tool functionality. This room will cover investigating packet-level details by synthesising the analyst knowledge and  Wireshark functionality for detecting anomalies and odd situations for a given case.

Note: A VM is attached to this room. You don't need SSH or RDP; the room provides a "Split View" feature. DO NOT directly interact with any domains and IP addresses in this room. The domains and IP addresses are included only for reference reasons.

## Task 2  Nmap Scans

### Nmap Scans

Nmap is an industry-standard tool for mapping networks, identifying live hosts and discovering the services. As it is one of the most used network scanner tools, a security analyst should identify the network patterns created with it. This section will cover identifying the most common Nmap scan types.

- TCP connect scans
- SYN scans
- UDP scans

It is essential to know how Nmap scans work to spot scan activity on the network. However, it is impossible to understand the scan details without using the correct filters. Below are the base filters to probe Nmap scan behaviour on the network. 

TCP flags in a nutshell.

- `Synchronization` (`SYN`) 
  â€“ It is used in first step of connection establishment phase or 3-way handshake process between the two hosts. Only the first packet from sender as well as receiver should have this flag set. This is used for synchronizing sequence number i.e. to tell the other end which sequence number they should accept.

- `Acknowledgement` (`ACK`)
  - It is used to acknowledge packets which are successful received by the host. The flag is set if the acknowledgement number field contains a valid acknowledgement number. 
In given below diagram, the receiver sends an ACK = 1 as well as SYN = 1 in the second step of connection establishment to tell sender that it received its initial packet. 
 
- `Finish` (`FIN`) 
  - It is used to request for connection termination i.e. when there is no more data from the sender, it requests for connection termination. This is the last packet sent by sender. It frees the reserved resources and gracefully terminate the connection. 
 
- `Reset` (`RST`) 
  - It is used to terminate the connection if the RST sender feels something is wrong with the TCP connection or that the conversation should not exist. It can get send from receiver side when packet is send to particular host that was not expecting it. 

- `Push` (`PSH`) 
  - Transport layer by default waits for some time for application layer to send enough data equal to maximum segment size so that the number of packets transmitted on network minimizes which is not desirable by some application like interactive applications(chatting). Similarly transport layer at receiver end buffers packets and transmit to application layer if it meets certain criteria. 
This problem is solved by using PSH. Transport layer sets PSH = 1 and immediately sends the segment to network layer as soon as it receives signal from application layer. Receiver transport layer, on seeing PSH = 1 immediately forwards the data to application layer. 
In general, it tells the receiver to process these packets as they are received instead of buffering them. 
 
- `Urgent` (`URG`) 
  - Data inside a segment with URG = 1 flag is forwarded to application layer immediately even if there are more data to be given to application layer. It is used to notify the receiver to process the urgent packets before processing all other packets. The receiver will be notified when all known urgent data has been received.

### TCP Connect Scans

TCP Connect Scan in a nutshell:

- Relies on the three-way handshake (needs to finish the handshake process).
- Usually conducted with `nmap -sT` command.
- Used by non-privileged users (only option for a non-root user).
- Usually has a windows size larger than 1024 bytes as the request expects some data due to the nature of the protocol.

The images below show the three-way handshake process of the open and close TCP ports. Images and pcap samples are split to make the investigation easier and understand each case's details.

Open TCP port (Connect):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203868119-43dd60fa-72ed-4d12-a643-cac295140558.png)

Closed TCP port (Connect):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203868136-b158d2b2-f671-43d4-b680-7edaa7f9892b.png)

The above images provide the patterns in isolated traffic. However, it is not always easy to spot the given patterns in big capture files. Therefore analysts need to use a generic filter to view the initial anomaly patterns, and then it will be easier to focus on a specific traffic point. The given filter shows the TCP Connect scan patterns in a capture file.

- `tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0 and tcp.window_size > 1024 `

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203868154-6b56e2f8-d8bc-4aaf-8b81-8b15ec5e3216.png)


### SYN Scans

TCP SYN Scan in a nutshell:

- Doesn't rely on the three-way handshake (no need to finish the handshake process).
- Usually conducted with `nmap -sS` command.
- Used by privileged users.
- Usually have a size less than or equal to 1024 bytes as the request is not finished and it doesn't expect to receive data.

Open TCP port (SYN):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203868239-86f5a65e-4d32-4fb2-b7d7-6aa4c9045981.png)

Closed TCP port (SYN):

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203868268-cbf65735-7e63-4450-84be-c9c3eb797099.png)

The given filter shows the TCP SYN scan patterns in a capture file.

- `tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0 and tcp.window_size <= 1024`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203868326-810ff65c-ecd6-4f2f-982c-ecff60221f0a.png)


### UDP Scans

UDP Scan in a nutshell:

- Doesn't require a handshake process
- No prompt for open ports
- ICMP error message for close ports
- Usually conducted with `nmap -sU` command.

Closed (port no 69) and open (port no 68) UDP ports:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203868339-a1e2d08c-14e6-47a6-83a5-fdaa7e312197.png)

The above image shows that the closed port returns an ICMP error packet. No further information is provided about the error at first glance, so how can an analyst decide where this error message belongs? The ICMP error message uses the original request as encapsulated data to show the source/reason of the packet. Once you expand the ICMP section in the packet details pane, you will see the encapsulated data and the original request, as shown in the below image.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203868361-c3e60385-65a8-4874-b36c-3f78f4f105a8.png)

The given filter shows the UDP scan patterns in a capture file.

- `icmp.type==3 and icmp.code==3`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203881339-97261194-3d49-4420-af9f-3180dd7841a4.png)

Detecting suspicious activities in chunked files is easy and a great way to learn how to focus on the details. Now use the exercise files to put your skills into practice against a single capture file and answer the questions below!

## Task 3  ARP Poisoning & Man In The Middle!

### ARP Poisoning/Spoofing (A.K.A. Man In The Middle Attack)

ARP protocol, or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), is the technology responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network. Address Resolution Protocol Poisoning (also known as ARP Spoofing or Man In The Middle (MITM) attack) is a type of attack that involves network jamming/manipulating by sending malicious ARP packets to the default gateway. The ultimate aim is to manipulate the "IP to MAC address table" and sniff the traffic of the target host.

There are a variety of tools available to conduct ARP attacks. However, the mindset of the attack is static, so it is easy to detect such an attack by knowing the ARP protocol workflow and Wireshark skills.    

#### ARP analysis in a nutshell:

- Works on the local network
- Enables the communication between MAC addresses
- Not a secure protocol
- Not a routable protocol
- It doesn't have an authentication function
- Common patterns are request & response, announcement and gratuitous packets.

Before investigating the traffic, let's review some legitimate and suspicious ARP packets. The legitimate requests are similar to the shown picture: a broadcast request that asks if any of the available hosts use an IP address and a reply from the host that uses the particular IP address.

  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

A suspicious situation means having two different ARP responses (conflict) for a particular IP address. In that case, Wireshark's expert info tab warns the analyst. However, it only shows the second occurrence of the duplicate value to highlight the conflict. Therefore, identifying the malicious packet from the legitimate one is the analyst's challenge. A possible IP spoofing case is shown in the picture below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203881594-8475ec59-cd8b-4829-a71d-eb723e446dc9.png)

Here, knowing the network architecture and inspecting the traffic for a specific time frame can help detect the anomaly. As an analyst, you should take notes of your findings before going further. This will help you be organised and make it easier to correlate the further findings. Look at the given picture; there is a conflict; the MAC address that ends with "b4" crafted an ARP request with the "192.168.1.25" IP address, then claimed to have the "192.168.1.1" IP address.


<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Notes</th>
    <th>Detection Notes<br></th>
    <th>Findings</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Possible IP address match.<br></td>
    <td>1 IP address announced from a MAC address.<br></td>
    <td>MAC: 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4<br>IP: 192.168.1.25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Possible ARP spoofing attempt.<br></td>
    <td>2 MAC addresses claimed the same IP address (192.168.1.1).<br>The " 192.168.1.1" IP address is a possible gateway address.<br></td>
    <td>MAC1: 50:78:b3:f3:cd:f4<br>MAC 2: 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Possible ARP flooding attempt.<br></td>
    <td>The MAC address that ends with "b4" claims to have a different/new IP address.<br></td>
    <td>MAC: 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4<br>IP: 192.168.1.1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Let's keep inspecting the traffic to spot any other anomalies. Note that the case is split into multiple capture files to make the investigation easier.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203881631-4c49eaca-55aa-47c4-ab50-254db951c70d.png)

At this point, it is evident that there is an anomaly. A security analyst cannot ignore a flood of ARP requests. This could be malicious activity, scan or network problems. There is a new anomaly; the MAC address that ends with "b4" crafted multiple ARP requests with the "192.168.1.25" IP address. Let's focus on the source of this anomaly and extend the taken notes. 

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Notes</th>
    <th>Detection Notes</th>
    <th>Findings</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Possible IP address match.<br></td>
    <td>1 IP address announced from a MAC address.<br></td>
    <td><br>MAC: 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4<br>IP: 192.168.1.25<br></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Possible ARP spoofing attempt.<br></td>
    <td><br>2 MAC addresses claimed the same IP address (192.168.1.1).The " 192.168.1.1" IP address is a possible gateway address.<br></td>
    <td>MAC1: 50:78:b3:f3:cd:f4<br>MAC 2: 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Possible ARP spoofing attempt.<br></td>
    <td>The MAC address that ends with "b4" claims to have a different/new IP address.<br></td>
    <td>MAC: 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4<br>IP: 192.168.1.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Possible ARP flooding attempt.<br></td>
    <td>The MAC address that ends with "b4" crafted multiple ARP requests against a range of IP addresses.</td>
    <td>MAC: 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4<br>IP: 192.168.1.xxx</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Up to this point, it is evident that the MAC address that ends with "b4" owns the "192.168.1.25" IP address and crafted suspicious ARP requests against a range of IP addresses. It also claimed to have the possible gateway address as well. Let's focus on other protocols and spot the reflection of this anomaly in the following sections of the time frame. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203881679-1c39a56c-9978-445a-a1d3-ae761913bceb.png)

There is HTTP traffic, and everything looks normal at the IP level, so there is no linked information with our previous findings. Let's add the MAC addresses as columns in the packet list pane to reveal the communication behind the IP addresses.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/203881722-bfcc2b9b-518d-4b46-a5ae-8ae31f379dee.png)

One more anomaly! The MAC address that ends with "b4" is the destination of all HTTP packets! It is evident that there is a MITM attack, and the attacker is the host with the MAC address that ends with "b4". All traffic linked to "192.168.1.12" IP addresses is forwarded to the malicious host. Let's summarise the findings before concluding the investigation.  

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Detection Notes</th>
    <th>Findings</th>
    <th></th>
  </tr>

<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>IP to MAC matches.</td>
    <td>3  IP to MAC address matches. </td>
    <td><br>MAC: 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4 = IP: 192.168.1.25<br>MAC: 50:78:b3:f3:cd:f4 = IP: 192.1681.1<br>MAC: 00:0c:29:98:c7:a8 = IP: 192.168.1.12<br></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Attacker</td>
    <td>The attacker created noise with ARP packets.<br></td>
    <td>MAC: 00:0c:29:e2:18:b4 = IP: 192.168.1.25<br></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Router/gateway<br></td>
    <td>Gateway address.<br></td>
    <td>MAC: 50:78:b3:f3:cd:f4 = IP: 192.1681.1<br></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Victim<br></td>
    <td>The attacker sniffed all traffic of the victim.</td>
    <td>MAC: 50:78:b3:f3:cd:f4 = IP: 192.1681.12<br></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Detecting these bits and pieces of information in a big capture file is challenging. However, in real-life cases, you will not have "tailored data" ready for investigation. Therefore you need to have the analyst mindset, knowledge and tool skills to filter and detect the anomalies. 

Note: In traffic analysis, there are always alternative solutions available. The solution type and the approach depend on the analyst's knowledge and skill level and the available data sources. 

Detecting suspicious activities in chunked files is easy and a great way to learn how to focus on the details. Now use the exercise files to put your skills into practice against a single capture file and answer the questions below!
