The room invites you a challenge to investigate a series of traffic data and stop malicious activity under two different scenarios. Let's start working with Snort to analyse live and captured traffic.

We recommend completing the [Snort room](https://tryhackme.com/room/snort) first, which will teach you how to use the tool in depth.
