## Task 1  Introduction

In this room, we will cover the fundamentals of packet analysis with Wireshark and investigate the event of interest at the packet-level. Note that this is the second room of the Wireshark room trio, and it is suggested to visit the first room ([Wireshark: The Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharkthebasics)) to practice and refresh your Wireshark skills before starting this one.

In the first room, we covered the basics of the Wireshark by focusing on how it operates and how to use it to investigate traffic captures. In this room, we will cover advanced features of the Wireshark by focusing on packet-level details with Wireshark statistics, filters, operators and functions.

Note: A VM is attached to this room. You don't need SSH or RDP; the room provides a "Split View" feature. Access to the machine will be provided in-browser and will deploy in Split View mode in your browser. If you don't see it, use the blue Show Split View button at the top right of this room page to show it. DO NOT directly interact with any domains and IP addresses in this room. The domains and IP addresses are included for reference reasons only.
