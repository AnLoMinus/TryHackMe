This room expects you to be familiar with basic Linux command-line functionalities like general system navigation and Network fundamentals (ports, protocols and traffic data). The room aims to encourage you to start working with Snort to analyse live and captured traffic.

Before joining this room, we suggest completing the '[Network Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-fundamentals)' module. If you have general knowledge of network basics and Linux fundamentals, you will be ready to begin! If you feel you need assistance in the Linux command line, you can always refer to our "Linux Fundamentals" rooms (here [1](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1) [2](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart2) [3](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart3)); 

SNORT is an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS). It was developed and still maintained by Martin Roesch, open-source contributors, and the Cisco Talos team. 

[The official description](https://www.snort.org/): "Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and generate alerts for users."
