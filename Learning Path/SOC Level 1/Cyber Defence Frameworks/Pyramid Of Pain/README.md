## Task 1  Introduction

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/201240599-9d5c736c-0c3f-4850-8113-478054232fbc.png)

Below is the breakdown of each indicator:

- Hash Values (`TRIVIAL`): SHA1, MD5, SHA256 or other similar hashes that identify a suspicious or malicious file. It is trivial for the adversary to change the value of the hash bypassing the defensive capability: For example, polymorphic or metamorphic techniques.

- IP Addresses (`EASY`): IP addresses are used as an identifier and can be easily hidden by using an anonymous proxy service (like Tor) or they can be changed at high frequency such as leveraging fast flux.

- Domain Names (`SIMPLE`): Domain names (e.g., “internetbadguys.com”) and/or or sub domain (e.g., “exploitkit.internetbadguys.com”). These domains are registered and hosted and can be part of the adversary’s attack infrastructure. The attackers can simply bypass these controls using techniques such as DGAs (Domain Generated Algorithms).

- Network Artifacts (`ANNOYING`): This refers to the ability to determine suspicious or malicious activity from legitimate activity. It goes beyond a user device and includes all Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Examples may include patterns based on network activity (C2 information), Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) patterns, certificates of use, and so on.

- Host Artifacts (`ANNOYING`): This may include an artifact in the registry, a scheduled task, or files dropped within the file system that indicates the presence of malicious activity.

- Tools (`CHALLENGING`): This would typically be software that the adversary brings with them to perform a variety of activities such as creating backdoors for a C2 channel, network sniffers, and password crackers.

- Tactics, Techniques and Procedures – TTPs (`TOUGH`): The tactic provides the description of the behavior, the technique provides more details of the behavior from the perspective of the tactic, and the procedure would provide deep details around the technique itself. Example: The Tactic is “Discovery” and technique being used is “Network Service Scanning.”

This well-renowned concept is being applied to cybersecurity solutions like [Cisco Security](https://gblogs.cisco.com/ca/2020/08/26/the-canadian-bacon-cisco-security-and-the-pyramid-of-pain/), [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/revisiting-the-pyramid-of-pain-leveraging-edr-data-to-improve-cyber-threat-intelligence/), and [SOCRadar](https://socradar.io/re-examining-the-pyramid-of-pain-to-use-cyber-threat-intelligence-more-effectively/) to improve the effectiveness of CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence), threat hunting, and incident response exercises.

Understanding the Pyramid of Pain concept as a Threat Hunter, Incident Responder, or SOC Analyst is important.

## Task 2  Hash Values (Trivial)

As per Microsoft, the hash value is a numeric value of a fixed length that uniquely identifies data. A hash value is the result of a hashing algorithm. The following are some of the most common hashing algorithms: 

- MD5 (Message Digest, defined by [RFC 1321](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt)) - was designed by Ron Rivest in 1992 and is a widely used cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash value. MD5 hashes are NOT considered cryptographically secure. In 2011, the IETF published RFC 6151, "[Updated Security Considerations for the MD5 Message-Digest and the HMAC-MD5 Algorithms](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6151)," which mentioned a number of attacks against MD5 hashes, including the hash collision.
- SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1, defined by [RFC 3174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3174)) - was invented by United States National Security Agency in 1995. When data is fed to SHA-1 Hashing Algorithm, SHA-1 takes an input and produces a 160-bit hash value string as a 40 digit hexadecimal number. [NIST deprecated the use of SHA-1 in 2011](https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2017/research-results-on-sha-1-collisions) and banned its use for digital signatures at the end of 2013 based on it being susceptible to brute-force attacks. Instead, NIST recommends migrating from SHA-1 to stronger hash algorithms in the SHA-2 and SHA-3 families.
- The SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) - SHA-2 Hashing Algorithm was designed by The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2001 to replace SHA-1. SHA-2 has many variants, and arguably the most common is SHA-256. The SHA-256 algorithm returns a hash value of 256-bits as a 64 digit hexadecimal number.
A hash is not considered to be cryptographically secure if two files have the same hash value or digest.

Security professionals usually use the hash values to gain insight into a specific malware sample, a malicious or a suspicious file, and as a way to uniquely identify and reference the malicious artifact.

You probably read the ransomware reports in the past, where security researchers would provide the hashes related to the malicious or suspicious files used at the end of the report. You can check out The [DFIR Report](https://thedfirreport.com/) and [FireEye Threat Research Blogs](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research.html) if you’re interested in seeing an example.

Various online tools can be used to do hash lookups like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) and [Metadefender Cloud - OPSWAT](https://metadefender.opswat.com/?lang=en).

As you might have noticed, it is really easy to spot a malicious file if we have the hash in our arsenal.  However, as an attacker, it’s trivial to modify a file by even a single bit, which would produce a different hash value. With so many variations and instances of known malware or ransomware, threat hunting using file hashes as the IOC (Indicators of Compromise) can become a difficult task.

Let’s take a look at an example of how you can change the hash value of a file by simply appending a string to the end of a file using echo: File Hash (Before Modification)

```powershell
PS C:\Users\THM\Downloads> Get-FileHash .\OpenVPN_2.5.1_I601_amd64.msi -Algorithm MD5

_________ ____                             ____

```

```powershell
PS C:\Users\THM\Downloads> echo "AppendTheHash" >> .\OpenVPN_2.5.1_I601_amd64.msi

_________ ____                             ____
