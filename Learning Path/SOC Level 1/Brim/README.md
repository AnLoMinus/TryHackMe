## Task 1  Introduction

[BRIM](https://www.brimdata.io/) is an open-source desktop application that processes pcap files and logs files. Its primary focus is providing search and analytics. In this room, you will learn how to use Brim, process pcap files and investigate log files to find the needle in the haystack! This room expects you to be familiar with basic security concepts and processing Zeek log files. We suggest completing the "[Network Fundamentals](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-fundamentals)" path and the "[Zeek room](https://tryhackme.com/room/zeekbro)" before starting working in this room. 

A VM is attached to this room. You don't need SSH or RDP; the room provides a "Split View" feature. Exercise files are located in the folder on the desktop. 
> `NOTE`: DO NOT directly interact with any domains and IP addresses in this room.
