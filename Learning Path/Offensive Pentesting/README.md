# Getting Started
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/173152018-ef43e9ad-a4ed-4c62-bfd1-f0295b3a437f.png)
- Lets get started with a few easy rooms which will give you practice in the following areas:
  - Active Reconnaissance
  - Vulnerability Scanning
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Web Application Attacks
- Its important to take notes when attacking machines, as you will usually be required to explain the vulnerabilities to both a technical and non technical audience. 
> To get practice, why not take notes or write a blog post for each room you complete?

<br>

- [x] Tutorial
  > Learn how to use a TryHackMe room to start your upskilling in cyber security.

- [x] Vulnversity
  > Learn about active recon, web app attacks and privilege escalation.

- [ ] Blue
  > Deploy & hack into a Windows machine, leveraging common misconfigurations issues.

- [x] Kenobi
  > Walkthrough on exploiting a Linux machine. Enumerate Samba for shares, manipulate a vulnerable version of proftpd and escalate your privileges with path variable manipulation.

- Now you've warmed up, its time for you to dive a little deeper. 
- Complete the following rooms and get practice in:
  - Vulnerability Scanning
  - Handling Public Exploits
  - Password Cracking
  - Metasploit Framework
  - Port Redirection

# Buffer Overflow Exploitation
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/173152060-0a2e244a-a157-4793-8314-3badbb13642a.png)
- Buffer overflows are used in many of the exploits that we use against vulnerable services, however most of these are pre-compiled by exploit developers. 
- In this section users will learn the foundations of
  - Windows buffer overflow vulnerabilities
  - Basic exploit development
  - Exploitation of services vulnerable to buffer overflow

<br>


- [ ] [Buffer Overflow Prep]()
  > Practice stack based buffer overflows!

- [ ] [Brainstorm]()
  > Reverse engineer a chat program and write a script to exploit a Windows machine.

- [ ] [Gatekeeper]()
  > Can you get past the gate and through the fire?

- [ ] [Brainpan 1]()
  > Reverse engineer a Windows executable, find a buffer overflow and exploit it on a Linux machine.

- Windows Active Directory environments by and large dominate the corporate and governmental world's organizational networking structure. 
- Active Directory allows user and service interaction from machines within the domain, rather than individual workstations. 
- A Domain Controller manages user accounts, services, networking shares, and more. In this section, users will learn about:
  - Active Directory Basics
  - Attacking Kerberos
  - Exploiting a Domain Controller
  - Post exploitation tasks

<br>


- [x] [Active Directory Basics]()
  > Learn the basics of Active Directory and how it is used in the real world today

- [ ] [Attacking Kerberos]()
  > Learn how to abuse the Kerberos Ticket Granting Service inside of a Windows Domain Controller

- [ ] [Attacktive Directory]()
  > 99% of Corporate networks run off of AD. But can you exploit a vulnerable Domain Controller?

- [ ] [Post-Exploitation Basics]()
  > Learn the basics of post-exploitation and maintaining access with mimikatz, bloodhound, powerview and msfvenom
