# Getting Started

- Lets get started with a few easy rooms which will give you practice in the following areas:
  - Active Reconnaissance
  - Vulnerability Scanning
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Web Application Attacks
- Its important to take notes when attacking machines, as you will usually be required to explain the vulnerabilities to both a technical and non technical audience. 
> To get practice, why not take notes or write a blog post for each room you complete?

- Now you've warmed up, its time for you to dive a little deeper. 
- Complete the following rooms and get practice in:
  - Vulnerability Scanning
  - Handling Public Exploits
  - Password Cracking
  - Metasploit Framework
  - Port Redirection

# Buffer Overflow Exploitation
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/173152060-0a2e244a-a157-4793-8314-3badbb13642a.png)
- Buffer overflows are used in many of the exploits that we use against vulnerable services, however most of these are pre-compiled by exploit developers. 
- In this section users will learn the foundations of
  - Windows buffer overflow vulnerabilities
  - Basic exploit development
  - Exploitation of services vulnerable to buffer overflow

# Active Directory
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51442719/173152071-fa4fb59e-ff8e-4551-98b9-52afb6d9e327.png)
- Windows Active Directory environments by and large dominate the corporate and governmental world's organizational networking structure. 
- Active Directory allows user and service interaction from machines within the domain, rather than individual workstations. 
- A Domain Controller manages user accounts, services, networking shares, and more. In this section, users will learn about:
  - Active Directory Basics
  - Attacking Kerberos
  - Exploiting a Domain Controller
  - Post exploitation tasks

- Having come this far, these rooms should be a breeze for you to complete.
- As TryHackMe releases more content, this pathway is constantly being developed, and so more rooms might be added.
