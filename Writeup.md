            <p><span>Before going into cyber security careers and what offensive security is, let's get you hacking (and yes, its&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:1rem">legal,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:1rem">all exercises are fake simulations)</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:24px">Your first hack</span></p>
            <p>Click the "Start Machine" button. Once loaded, you will have access to a machine you'll use to hack a fake bank application called FakeBank.<br></p>
            <p><span>We will use a <a class="TeyNIYsb glossary-term" onclick="initPopOver('command-line application', 'TeyNIYsb')">command-line application</a> called "GoBuster" to brute-force FakeBank's website to find hidden directories and pages. GoBuster will take a list of potential page or directory names and tries accessing a website with each of them; if the page exists, it tells you.</span><span style="font-size:1rem"><br></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:20px">Step 1) Open a terminal</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:1rem">A terminal, also known as the command-line, allows us to interact with a computer without using a graphical user interface.</span>On the machine, open the terminal using the Terminal icon:&nbsp;<img style="font-size:1rem;width:0px;height:0px"><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5bec5dfd73790a7d06282266/room-content/443d573c553e59e4897aa99d2e77b679.png" style="font-size:1rem;width:23.2422px;height:23.2422px"><span style="font-size:1rem">&nbsp;</span></p>
            </span>
            </span>
            <p><span style="font-size:20px">Step 2) Find hidden website pages</span></p>
            <p>Most companies will have an admin portal page, giving their staff access to basic admin controls for day-to-day operations. For a bank, an employee might need to transfer money to and from client accounts. Often these pages are not made private, allowing attackers to find hidden pages that show, or give access to, admin controls or sensitive data.</p>
            <p><span style="font-size:1rem">Type the following command into the terminal to find potentially hidden pages on FakeBank's website using GoBuster (a command-line security application)</span><span style="font-size:20px"><br></span></p>
            </span>
            </span>
            <p style="text-align:right"><i>Don't worry if you have not used a terminal before - TryHackMe walks you through everything!</i></p>
            <p >In the command above, <code>-u</code> is used to state the website we're scanning, <code>-w</code> takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages.</p>
            <p>You will see that GoBuster scans the website with each word in the list, finding pages that exist on the site. GoBuster will have told you the pages it found in the list of page/directory names (indicated by Status: 200).</p>

            <p>To beat a hacker, you need to behave like a hacker, finding vulnerabilities and recommending patches before a cybercriminal does, as you did in this room!</p>

            <p>In a defensive cyber role, you could be investigating infected computers or devices to understand how it was hacked, tracking down cybercriminals, or monitoring infrastructure for&nbsp;<span style="background-color:rgb(250, 250, 250);font-size:1rem">malicious activity.</span></p>

            <p><span style="font-size:24px">How can I start learning?</span></p>
            <p>People often wonder how others become hackers (security consultants) or defenders (security analysts fighting cybercrime), and the answer is simple. Break it down, learn an area of cyber security you're interested in, and regularly practice using hands-on exercises. Build a habit of learning a little bit each day on TryHackMe, and you'll acquire the knowledge to get your first job in the industry.</p>
            <p>Trust us; you can do it! Just take a look at some people who have used TryHackMe to get their first security job:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Paul went from a construction worker to a security engineer. <a href="https://tryhackme.com/resources/blog/construction-worker-to-security-engineer-how-paul-used-tryhackme-to-land-his-first-job-in-security" target="_blank">Read more</a>.<br></li>

            <p>The cyber careers room goes into more depth about the different careers in cyber. However, here is a short description of a few offensive security roles:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Penetration Tester - Responsible for testing technology products for finding exploitable security vulnerabilities.</li>
              <li>Red Teamer - Plays the role of an adversary, attacking an organization and providing feedback from an enemy's perspective.</li>
              <li>Security Engineer - Design, monitor, and maintain security controls, networks, and systems to help prevent cyberattacks.</li>
            </ul>
